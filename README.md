# TLabImageCrop
This is software that performs mask clipping using both the mask image and the original image.  
If you use a high-resolution image, you can cut it out more neatly. Also,  
since the image size is compressed in the program, by changing the parameters in the code,  
even large images can be changed to any size after clipping.
